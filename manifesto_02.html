    <p>1. Forget all the standard art forms.</p>
    <p>Don’t paint pictures, don’t make poetry, don’t build architecture, don’t arrange dances, don’t write plays, don’t compose music, don’t make movies, and above all, don’t think you’ll get a happening out of putting all these together. This idea is nothing more than what operas always did and you see it today in the far-out types of discotheques with their flashing lights and film projections. The point is to make something new, something that doesn’t even remotely remind you of culture. You’ve got to be pretty ruthless about this, wiping out of your plans every echo of this or that story or jazz piece or painting that I can promise you will keep coming up unconsciously.</p>
    <p>2. You can steer clear of art by mixing up your happening by mixing it with life situations.</p>
    <p>Make it unsure even to yourself if the happening is life or art. Art has always been different from the world’s affairs, now you’ve got to work hard to keep it all blurry. Two cars collide on a highway. Violet liquid pours out of the broken radiator of one of them, and in the back seat of the other there is a huge load of dead chickens that is spilling out all over the ground. The cops check it out, plausible answers are given, tow trucks carry off the wrecks costs are paid and the drivers go home to dinner.</p>
    <p>3. The situations for a happening should come from what you see in the real world, from real places and people rather than from the head.</p>
    <p>If you stick to imagination too much you’ll end up with old art again, since art was always supposed to be made from imagination. Take advantage of readymade events: a factory fire, the fire trucks screaming to it from all sides, the water, the police barricades, the red blinkers—a natural. Or after a storm at the shore the debris washed up can be terrific. Or just take an afternoon off and watch women trying on dresses in a bargain basement. An awful lot can be done with images like these. If you get stuck for ideas, an exception to the slice-of-life idea is the greatest source book of our time, the yellow pages of the telephone directory. Break open the book at random, put your finger down at some point in the page and you’ll come up with: private detective service, rug cleaning at home, cement blocks, airport limousine transport, judo lessons. You can get more out of these than out of all of Beethoven, Michelangelo, and Racine put together.</p>
